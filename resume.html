    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of clients and in a variety of domains over my seven plus years of experience. I have experience working with companies like Google, Baxter, P&G, and AT&T. I worked as a QA Engineer Associate Consultant at Capgemini for the first three years of my career. During this time, I authored thorough test descriptions, conducted in-depth status checks, and actively participated in Defect Review sessions. I made a major contribution at every stage of the development life cycle, from specifying the system requirements to regularly maintaining and supporting web applications. After leaving Capgemini, I was employed as a Technical Lead at HCL for 4.2 years, collaborating closely with our client, Google. I oversaw the Google testing team in this capacity, optimized project schedules, and demonstrated my proficiency in thorough test design, regression testing, and automation. See the section on each company's experience for further details.</p>
